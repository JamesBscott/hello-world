Potential Ideas for algorithms and programs

I am wrapping up my applied mathematics and statistics major at ODU in Norfolk, VA (2018). I will graduate with a computer science minor as well. It is my aim to be a versatile analysts and data scientist. To bring my aspirations to fruition, I consistently work with C++, Matlab, R and other related environments to develop algorithms and programs to solve various problems relating to number theory and calculus as well as developing my capacity for graphically representing data to elucidate meaningful insight.
